#Udacity EU Scholarship - Development for Beginners - Court Counter App

**Project Overview**
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the course. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.
The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport. 
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

**Why this project?**
In the most recent portion of the course, you learned how to make use of Java in your Android apps to make them interactive. With Score Keeper, you will be practicing this skill set, with particular focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views. 

**What will I learn?**
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

> - Adding button code to your app
- Updating views
- Properly scoping variables
- Finding views by their ID
